# Why This Project Stands Out
Simplified Clean Architecture: Clear separation into modules (domain, application, interface, infrastructure).
Professional Documentation: Use-case diagrams, ER diagrams, and requirement analysis tables.
Scalable Infrastructure: PostgreSQL, AWS S3, Redis, and WebSockets integration.
Real-Time Interactivity: WebSocket-based chat and live order updates.

# üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview
The project follows a simplified Clean Architecture pattern:

Domain: Core business logic and domain entities.
Application: Use-cases coordinating domain and interface logic.
Interface: Controllers, forms, and external-facing APIs.
Infrastructure: ORM models, repositories, and external services (e.g., AWS, Redis).
This structure ensures:

Separation of concerns
Scalability
Testability
