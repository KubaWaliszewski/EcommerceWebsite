# üåêWhy This Project Stands Out
**Simplified Clean Architecture**

+ Clear separation into modules (domain, application, interface, infrastructure).
+ Professional Documentation: Use-case diagrams, ER diagrams, and requirement analysis tables.
+ Scalable Infrastructure: PostgreSQL, AWS S3, Redis, and WebSockets integration.
+ Real-Time Interactivity: WebSocket-based chat and live order updates.

# üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview
The project follows a simplified Clean Architecture pattern adapted to the Django MVT (Model-View-Template) structure. Below is an explanation of how Clean Architecture concepts map onto Django's MVT:

**Domain**
 + Core business logic and domain entities.
 + Defined in Django models and custom services where necessary.
 
**Application**
 + Orchestrates use-cases, coordinating domain and interface logic.
 + Includes service layers and utility functions to handle specific tasks.
 
**Interface**
 + Views and forms serve as controllers.
 + User-facing interaction logic resides here.


**Infrastructure**
 + ORM models handle database interactions.
 + Integration with external services (e.g., AWS S3, Redis).
 + Configuration and environment management.
___
**This structure ensures:**


‚úÖ Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries between business logic, presentation, and data management.

‚úÖ Scalability: Easy to extend functionality without introducing tight coupling.

‚úÖ Testability: Individual layers can be tested independently.


Even though the project follows Django's MVT structure, the principles of Clean Architecture are applied consistently to maintain clarity and modularity.
