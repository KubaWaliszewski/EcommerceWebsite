# üõíEcommerceWebsite
A professional and scalable e-commerce platform built with Django following a simplified Clean Architecture approach.

This project demonstrates a modular and maintainable structure, complete with robust documentation, including use-case diagrams, ER diagrams, and a detailed functional requirements table.


# üöÄAbout the Project
EcommerceWebsite serves as a fully functional online store, designed with scalability, clean code principles, and separation of concerns in mind. The platform features user account management, admin controls, real-time chat, and seamless order and payment workflows.

# Why This Project Stands Out
Simplified Clean Architecture: Clear separation into modules (domain, application, interface, infrastructure).
Professional Documentation: Use-case diagrams, ER diagrams, and requirement analysis tables.
Scalable Infrastructure: PostgreSQL, AWS S3, Redis, and WebSockets integration.
Real-Time Interactivity: WebSocket-based chat and live order updates.

# üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview
The project follows a simplified Clean Architecture pattern adapted to the Django MVT (Model-View-Template) structure. Below is an explanation of how Clean Architecture concepts map onto Django's MVT:

1. Domain:
 + Core business logic and domain entities.
 + Defined in Django models and custom services where necessary.
 
2. Application:
 + Orchestrates use-cases, coordinating domain and interface logic.
 + Includes service layers and utility functions to handle specific tasks.
 
3. Interface:
 + Views and forms serve as controllers.
 + User-facing interaction logic resides here.
 + API endpoints (if any) are defined in views.

4. Infrastructure:
 + ORM models handle database interactions.
 + Integration with external services (e.g., AWS S3, Redis).
 + Configuration and environment management.

This structure ensures:
‚úÖ Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries between business logic, presentation, and data management.
‚úÖ Scalability: Easy to extend functionality without introducing tight coupling.
‚úÖ Testability: Individual layers can be tested independently.

Even though the project follows Django's MVT structure, the principles of Clean Architecture are applied consistently to maintain clarity and modularity.
